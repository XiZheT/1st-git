times slows down when it can get no worst
i can feel it running out on me
i don't want these to be my last words

Now there's only one thing i can do


wishing there was sonething...



wish i have something left to lose 
this could be the day i die for you
this could be the day i die for you
this could be the day i die for you

everything i know ...

everything i know everything i hold tight



this could be the day i die for you



feeling like theres nothing left to do
